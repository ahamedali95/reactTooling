Custom ReactTS development framework created from scratch to give a 
ready-made setup: 
1. Environment specific code bundling using Webpack 
2. Code transpilation using Babel along with integration with browserlist
to make compatible with modern day browsers.
3. Static analysis using TypeScript and ESLint for type-checking and linting, respectively.

THE END!
